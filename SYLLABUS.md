# MAT 236: Computational Systems for Visual Arts and Design

Instructor: Diarmid Flatley (diarmid@ucsb.edu) </br>
Course Design and Materials: Professor Jennifer Jacobs (jmjacobs@ucsb.edu)

Lecture Time: Tuesday-Thursday 3:00-5:50PM in Elings 2003

Office Hours: By appointment only


## Course Description
Computational systems of rules, relationships, and behaviors can extend traditional art and design practices or support new creative workflows and outcomes. In this course, we will explore the creation of computational systems for visual art and design. Following a studio format, we will use creative coding platforms and algorithms to create visual works that are flexible, dynamic, and generative. In the process, we will touch on the design philosophy and abstractions of existing creative coding platforms and examine methods to create alternatives. Students will learn basic approaches to modify creative programming languages and frameworks or develop new software interfaces for visual expression. Technical production will be complemented by readings on computational art and design theory and a review of seminal works in computational art and design.

## Course Goals

* Examine concrete opportunities and challenges of using computational methods to create works of visual art and design through creative practice.

* Contextualize practical approaches to creative coding within the history and theory of computational art and design.

* Introduce students to techniques for modifying existing programming languages, tools, and interfaces to support new audiences and new forms of expression.

* Engage in critical reflection on the dominant paradigms and approaches in computational art and design and explore alternatives.

* Provide an opportunity for students to develop their own artworks, software applications, and programming representations.

## Course Components
### Course Structure
The course meets on Mondays from 3:00-5:50 PM 

The course time will be split into discussions of weekly project assignments, discussions of the weekly readings, and lectures. 

Assignments should be posted to GitHub before **10am on Monday**. By the following Monday, students should also provide comments on the reading reflections of other students from the past week's reading.

Readings and reading reflection slides should be completed before **10am on Monday**. There are 7 total weekly reading reflections. 

**Asynchronous:** Instructor support.

**Final Project:** Please see [Final Project](https://github.com/CSVADWinter25/.github/blob/main/FINAL.md#final-project) detail page. 

### Readings and Discussions
Students will be assigned weekly readings drawn from Fine Art, Computer Graphics, Computational Design and Human Computer Interaction texts. Students are expected to complete the required readings and a reading reflection slide by **Monday at 10am**, as well as engage in group discussions in class. Students should also leave comments on at least 2 other reading reflection from their peers by the **following Monday**. 

### Code Assignments
Students will be assigned a weekly project on Monday, to be completed by the following **Monday by 10AM**. We will discuss projects in-class. 

Code assignments should be uploaded to the class GitHub organization.  

All code assignments will primarily be demonstrated in the Processing programming language, with some exceptions in C++, Python, and Javascript when necessitated by the assignment. However, students are free to use any language they wish to in the course of the class, as long as the language is capable of producing perceivable visual output and the code can be shared via github.  Some alternatives to Java processing include: [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) (javascript based), [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) (C++), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (Python), and [Max](https://cycling74.com/). 

### Participation
A portion of the class will be devoted to small group discussion of readings and concepts from the lecture, and group critique of peer work and presentations. Students are responsible for actively and thoughtfully contributing to these discussions and critiques. Students are also responsible for providing feedback on reading reflections and course assignments by other students. Students will also receive participation credit for supporting other students in addressing technical challenges or coding questions.

### Course Evaluation
Final grades will be calculated as follows: 

Weekly assignments (evaluated for completion, creativity, and variety)  35%
Reading reflections (evaluated both for quality and completion)  20%
Participation 15%
Final Project 30%
